# DOI of ISWC Papers

This repository contains the list of DOIs from the International Semantic Web Conference, from 2002 to 2024.

They have been collected for the purpose of creating a Nature Navigator topic [link](link), and a blog post on the conference website [link](link). In this case, we only included the papers available in LNCS proceedings. Hence, this excludes all workshop papers, doctoral consortium, and industry track, which are usually published through alternative outlets like CEUR.ws.

Specifically this repository contains two files:
* ISWC_DOIs_with_year.csv containing the conference DOIs and the year
* ISWC_DOIs_for_Nature_Navigator.csv containing just DOIs


In the last file (ISWC_DOIs_for_Nature_Navigator), we removed [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-77847-6_19](10.1007/978-3-031-77847-6_19) because it is a correction paper about the 2024 volume, and it was published in 2025, resulting in a slightly distorted analysis.
